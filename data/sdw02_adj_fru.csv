# Hato Raton. Weighted adjacency matrix, with elements corresponding to the 
# number of fruits recorded in feces. Figures are decimal because the number 
# of fruits present in a given sample were estimated from the remains of fruit 
# epidermis present, not only from the number of seeds. In this way, biases 
# are avoided of underestimating the number of frutis consumed for species 
# that regularly regurgitate seeds and thus rarely have seeds showing up in 
# feces.
# Cumulative dataset of fecal sample analysis for furgivorous birds.
# Each record is a fruit consumed (Snow and Snow 1982).
